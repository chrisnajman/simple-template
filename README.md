## JavaScript

Built with **vanilla ES6 JavaScript**, focusing on modern syntax and browser APIs.

The JavaScript has been split into separate modules, improving code modularity:

- `module-placeholder.js`: Empty module, imported into `index.js`.
- `theme.js`: Handles theme toggling (light/dark mode) and local storage management.

---

## Theme Toggling

The application includes a dark mode and light mode toggle:

- The current theme state is stored in **local storage** and applied automatically on page reload.
- Accessible buttons with appropriate ARIA attributes are used to improve usability.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember to change `const LOCAL_STORAGE_PREFIX` in `js-modules/theme.js` to a unique identifier.
